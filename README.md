# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

This is an interactive data visualization dashboard built using **D3.js** and **Plotly.js**. The dashboard displays information about bacterial species found in human belly buttons, based on data from a JSON file.

## Features

- **Dropdown Menu** to select test subject IDs  
- **Bar Chart** showing the Top 10 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) for each subject  
- **Bubble Chart** displaying all OTU samples for the selected subject  
- **Metadata Panel** displaying demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location)  
- **Responsive Layout** using Bootstrap for clean styling

## Project Structure
```

   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main HTML structure
   |   â”œâ”€â”€ static/
   |   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ js/
   |   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ app.js     # Core JavaScript logic (charts + interactivity)

## ðŸ“¥ Data Source

All visualizations are built from `samples.json`, which is hosted externally:

[samples.json](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json)

## How It Works

1. The page loads and fetches sample data using D3.
2. The dropdown menu is populated with subject IDs.
3. When a new ID is selected:
   - The **bar chart** and **bubble chart** update using Plotly.
   - The **metadata panel** updates with demographic info.
